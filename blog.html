            <li> A challenge I had was figuring out what image to choose of myself as I don't have much
                 that show me clearly. I worked through this by going through my photos and ultimately settling
                 on an image that seemed the most clear. Another challenge I had was figuring out how I wanted to 
                 publish these pages to the web. I worked through them through a lot of referencing of the assignment
                 prompt, and google searches. A third challenge was understanding the unix commands when publishing the 
                 pages on the ENGR web space. I worked through this through a mix of the links provided in the prompt
                 as well as some google searching as well. A fourth thing I encountered was figuring out how to change the 
                 background color, the text, and how to space things out between the text. I worked through this by doing 
                 some google searches, which have been very helpful. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Something I learned from this assignment was how to publish pages to the web, so that it's not only 
                viewable locally, but also live on the web. Another thing I learned was Unix permissions. I don't 
                entirely understand it all but I think I at least somewhat do and at least understand enough to 
                accomplish the needed permissions as specified. 

            </li>

            <li> 
                The resources that were most helpful were the links within the assignment #1 prompt, the campuswire forum, 
                and the notes I had from lectures. I used the campuswire forum by referring to it when I realized I had 
                similar if not the same questions that others had previously asked. I used the links and the notes I had
                from lectures whenever there was something I came across while doing the assignment that made me think of 
                something I saw earlier that could possibly help in solving it.

                Something challenging about this assignment was figuring out how to get something to look like how I expected.
                For example, there were numerous times where I envisioned what I wanted but just didn't know what exactly to 
                do in order to get it look the way I wanted. I solved these problems through extensive google searches, 
                referring to my notes, the lectures, and yeah. 
            </li>

            <li>
                I learned a lot about how to apply the CSS concepts that we went over during the past few weeks, as well as 
                a concepts that weren't exactly taught but were things I saw from my google searches that seemed to solve
                what I wanted to do. Yes, there were indeed some insights that I picked up from doing this assignment. 
                As I continued to do this assignment, some of the concepts that I wasn't understanding so much earlier 
                were starting to all come together, little by little. 
            </li>

            <li>
                The resources that were helpful are as follows: GOOGLE searches, lecture recordings, lecture notes, readings,
                notes I took myself, campuswire. I used google EXTENSIVELY when I wanted to find an answer to a question I had.
                I used the lecture recordings to reinforce specific concepts and especially those that Hess mentioned could be
                beneficial when working on this assignment. I used the lecture notes and readings assigned as well to clarify 
                things. I used the notes that I took as well (which is code that I followed during lecture) to find any comments
                I had that mentioned how something could be useful. Finally, I used campuswire to see if there was something that
                someone had previously asked about and was something I was wondering about. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Although there were definitely more than two things I googled for this assignment, one in particular was
                about flexboxes and flex items. Another thing was how to make something pop out (the add twit button).
                As mentioned, I used google for a lot more different searches but these in particular are just a few things
                I did search.
